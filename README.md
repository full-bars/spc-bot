# WxAlert / SPCBot

A sophisticated severe weather monitoring platform featuring real-time warning lifecycle tracking, automated damage survey mapping, and professional RAOB/ACARS sounding plots. Engineered for near-zero latency, it leverages **NWWS-OI (XMPP)** to deliver NWS products in sub-second timeframes. Built for enthusiasts and researchers with high-availability failover and interactive dashboards.

### Soundings & Analytics
| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| `/sounding` | Observed RAOB plots via SounderPy; supports city names, radar codes, and station IDs with interactive time selection |
| Watch-triggered soundings | Auto-posts soundings for RAOB stations near active watches — on issuance (any hour via IEM) and at 00z/12z synoptic cycles |
| MDT/HIGH risk sweep | On Moderate or High Risk days sweeps every RAOB station and ACARS airport inside the categorical polygon (100 km buffer) as new soundings arrive |
| `/hodograph` | VWP hodograph for any of 200 NEXRAD/TDWR sites; auto ASOS surface wind and storm parameter table |

### System
| Feature | Details |
|---|---|

| High availability | Leader election via Upstash lease; automatic Primary/Standby failover with no HTTP tunnel required |
| Watchdog | Dual-endpoint session probe (`api.weather.gov` + IEM); operator alerts to dev channel at 2/3 failures and on session reset |

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.12+ (matches the Dockerfile; 3.10/3.11 may still work but CI runs on 3.12)
* A Discord bot token and application ([Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications))
* Channel IDs and Guild ID for where the bot should post
* An [Upstash Redis](https://upstash.com/) instance *(optional, free tier is sufficient)* — only required for Primary/Standby failover. The bot runs fine on a single node without it.

## Setup

### 🐳 Docker (Recommended for most users)

The bot is now available as a pre-built image on GitHub Container Registry. This is the easiest way to run the bot with all scientific dependencies (MetPy, SounderPy) pre-configured.

1.  **Download configuration:**
    ```bash
    mkdir spc-bot && cd spc-bot
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/full-bars/spc-bot/main/docker-compose.yml
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/full-bars/spc-bot/main/.env.example
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
2.  **Configure:** Edit `.env` with your Discord token and channel IDs.
3.  **Launch:** `docker compose up -d`

### ⚡ Automatic Install (systemd-based linux)

A portable deploy script is included that creates a virtual environment, configures your `.env` interactively, and installs a systemd service. The bot runs as your current user for seamless code and log management.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/full-bars/spc-bot.git
cd spc-bot
sudo ./deploy.sh
```

The script will prompt you for your Discord bot token and setup the following aliases in your `.bashrc`:

```bash
spcon        # start the bot
spcoff       # stop the bot
spcrestart   # restart the bot
spcstatus    # show status dashboard
spclog       # follow live logs
spclog50     # show last 50 log lines
spcupdate    # pull latest code and restart
```

## High Availability (optional)

The bot supports an active/standby failover pair using Upstash Redis as a shared lease store. This section is only relevant if you want to run two nodes — a single install needs none of this.

### How it works

One node holds the Upstash lease and runs as **Primary** (posts to Discord, polls all feeds). The other runs as **Standby** (holds no lease, all cogs idle). If the Primary crashes or goes offline, the Standby detects the expired lease on its next heartbeat and promotes itself automatically — no manual intervention, no HTTP tunnel between nodes.

### Failover setup

1. **Create an Upstash Redis database** (free tier is enough) and note the REST URL and token.
2. **Set the following on both nodes** in `.env`:
   ```env
   UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=https://your-upstash-url.upstash.io
   UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your-upstash-token
   FAILOVER_TOKEN=some-long-random-shared-secret
   ADMIN_USER_ID=your_discord_user_id
   ```
3. **Set the initial role** on each node:
   ```env
   IS_PRIMARY=true   # on the Primary
   IS_PRIMARY=false  # on the Standby
   ```
   The bot uses leader election on every heartbeat regardless, so `IS_PRIMARY` only controls which cogs load at startup — it doesn't hard-lock a node to a role.
4. Start both nodes. Use `/failover` in Discord (restricted to `ADMIN_USER_ID`) to trigger a manual role swap at any time.

### Syncthing — events archive sync (optional)

The significant-weather events archive (`cache/events.db`) is a standalone SQLite file that never syncs to Upstash. To replicate it across nodes so the Standby has a current copy if it promotes:

1. **Install [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/)** on both nodes and pair them.
2. **Create a shared folder** pointing to the `cache/events_sync/` directory on each node. Note the folder ID Syncthing assigns.
3. **Add to `.env`** on both nodes:
   ```env
   SYNCTHING_API_KEY=your_local_syncthing_api_key
   SYNCTHING_FOLDER_ID=your-folder-id
   ```
4. The bot manages folder mode automatically — it sets the folder to **send-only** on the Primary and **receive-only** on the Standby, and flips the mode on promotion/demotion. No manual Syncthing configuration beyond pairing is required.
